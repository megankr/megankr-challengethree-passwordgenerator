# megankr-challengethree-passwordgenerator
A repository for the U of M Coding Bootcamp Challenge 3, a JavaScript password generator.

## Description

In this project, we were asked to create a secure password generator for those who work with sensitive data. Expectations of this password generator include the ability to select password lenght, characters, and cases. Once the user has chosen, the webpage will display an appropriate password fitting the user's requests.
